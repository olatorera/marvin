        <p>Mavin Records (also known as the Supreme Mavin Dynasty)[1] is a Nigerian record label founded by record producer and recording artist Don Jazzy on May 8, 2012. The label's inception came to fruition following the closure of Mo' Hits Records, a record label owned by the aforementioned producer and D'banj.[2] The label is home to recording artists such as Korede Bello, Dr SID, D'Prince, Di'Ja, Johnny Drille, Ladipoe, DNA Twins, Rema and Crayon. It also houses producers such as Jazzy himself, Altims and Baby Fresh.[3] In 2014, DJ Big N became the label's official disc jockey.[4] Tiwa Savage, Wande Coal, Reekado Banks and Iyanya were all formerly signed to the label.[5] On May 8, 2012, the label released its compilation album Solar Plexus.[6] In January 2019, Mavin Records secured a multi-million dollar investment from Kupanda Holdings, a subsidiary of Kupanda Capital and TPG Growth.
            Mavin Records started as a result of D'banj's departure from Mo' Hits. Prior to commenting on D'banj's exit from Mo' Hits, there were allegations that D'banj signed over Mo' Hits to Don Jazzy.[8] In an interview with Sunday Punch, Don Jazzy addressed D'banj's departure from Mo Hits, saying, "We were working together and all was going on well. It got to a point where I looked at the situation and we both decided that it was not working and we had to move on". Don Jazzy alluded to being hesitant of a name change.[9] According to BellaNaija, the term "Mavin" describes someone who is gifted and skilled in any field.[10] Upon establishing the rebranded record label, Don Jazzy said he sees Mavin Records being the power house of music in Africa in the shortest possible time.[10] After rebranding Mo' Hits to Mavin, Don Jazzy signed Nigerian singer Tiwa Savage. Pulse Nigeria reported that Jazzy admires the singer's work ethic and drive.[11] Pulse Nigeria also reported that Mavin Records signed producers Aluko "Altims" Timothy and Sunday "BabyFresh" Enejere.[12]      
            On May 7, 2012, the record label launched its official website and the Mavin league, a social networking site designed to cater to their fans worldwide.</p>
